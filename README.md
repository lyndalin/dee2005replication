# Replication of the study by Dee (2005)

The [R Markdown](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lyndalin/dee2005replication/blob/master/dee2005replication.html) shows the steps followed to replicate the study by [Dee (2005) "A teacher like me: Does race, ethnicity, or gender matter?"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4132809?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

The study used data from the [National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/data_products.asp)

The main analyses consist of fixed effects logit analyses done in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) using the *clogit* function in the [survival](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) package.
